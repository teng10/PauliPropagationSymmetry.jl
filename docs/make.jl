# Generates HTML documentation from the contents of
# the docs folder. To generate, we must first setup
# a symlink from the repo README.md to src/index.md,
# in order re-use the README in Documenter.jl
# From the docs/ directory (containing this file):
#     cd src
#     ln -s ../../README.md index.md
#     cd ../
#
# This need only be done once per-machine. Then,
# generating/updating the doc is triggered via
#     julia --project make.jl
# 
# If triggered within a Github Action, the generated
# HTML files will then be committed to the 'gh-pages'
# branch, which Github Pages can be configured to
# display at msrudolph.github.io/PauliPropagation.jl/
# 
# Note documentation generated from non-main branches
# will be uploaded to subdomain /dev/, even when not
# from the 'dev' branch, and doc generated from pull
# requests will be uploaded to /previews/PR#.
#
# If this breaks, break Tyson's legs
